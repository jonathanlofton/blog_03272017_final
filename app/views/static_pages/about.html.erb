<h1>About</h1>
<p>  Hello!</p>

  <p>My name is Jonathan, and welcome to my first website! As of typing this I don't even have
  this website deployed yet, but soon.. very soon, I hope it will be...</p>

  <p>Anyways! to give a brief description of myself we'll have to start in Tampa, Florida. Oh Boy!
    Where I was born and raised on an Orange grove!</p>

    <p>
      Where I ate oranges until I looked quite similar to a fairly famous business man. Hmmmmm,
      That last part was a lie, although I do enjoy oranges, I'm sorry to say I was born in the suburbs
      somwehere in the middle class, to parents who met working at a powerplant, how romantic :)
      *Kissy Sounds* From the suburbs to grade school, to college... it's the natural progression of
      life. Going into college, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I set up criteria for myself, if you
      going to school and you're not passionate about anything, go into the hard sciences, ok cool.

    <p>
      I wonder how long it will take to get this page up and running.
